Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. The webpage should be hosted on either Github Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. The webpage must also contain the date when the document was created.

World Cities Map
The map shows a map of the world cities. The data was taken from https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities

library(leaflet)

```{r}
df <- read.csv("worldcities.csv")
df %>% leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(
    lat = df$lat, 
    lng = df$lng, 
    popup = paste(df$popup, "<br>", "City:", df$city_ascii),
    clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
